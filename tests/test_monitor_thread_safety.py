"""Regression tests for ``RuntimeMonitor`` thread safety.

Two code paths drive ``RuntimeMonitor.check_action`` from multiple
threads in production:

1. ``api/state.py`` — a single ``AppState.monitor`` is shared across
   FastAPI sync routes, which FastAPI dispatches on a thread pool.
2. ``contragent.integrations.mcp.MCPContractProxy`` — the proxy is a
   singleton serving concurrent tool clients.

Pre-fix the ``check_action`` body was unlocked: ``trace.events.append``
+ ``verifier.sync`` + ``_atom_caches`` writes + ``_turn_spans.append``
all happened without any mutex. Two threads could interleave such that
(a) two events got the same ``ts`` (both read ``len`` before either
appended), (b) ``verifier._grounded_upto`` lagged behind
``len(trace.events)`` producing missing valuations, or (c)
``_atom_caches`` read the wrong cache entry for the wrong contract.

These tests pound the monitor with concurrent ``check_action`` and
assert that:

- All events get unique, contiguous ``ts`` values (``0..N-1``).
- ``len(trace.events) == N`` after ``N`` concurrent calls.
- ``len(turn_spans) == N`` — no dropped spans.
- No ``IndexError`` / ``KeyError`` / ``RuntimeError`` escaped the
  pipeline during the run.
