"""Finite-trace evaluator for the formula AST.

Evaluates any ``Formula`` tree against a grounded trace (a list of dicts
produced by ``tracer/grounding.py``).

Supports all three formula families:

- **Propositional** (Atom, Not, And, Or, Implies): standard boolean logic.
  ``Atom.key()`` is looked up in the current timestep's dict.
- **Temporal / LTL** (G, F, X, U): recursive evaluation using *weak
  finite-trace semantics* -- at the end of the trace, ``G`` is vacuously
  true and ``F`` is vacuously false.
- **Arithmetic** (Le, Lt, Ge, Gt, Eq): resolve ``Var``/``Const`` to
  numbers, then compare.
