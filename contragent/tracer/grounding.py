"""Grounding: convert a raw Trace into per-timestep predicate truth values.

This is the bridge between the runtime world (Events) and the formal world
(formula evaluation).  The evaluator operates on ``list[dict[str, bool]]``
-- it has no idea what a "tool call" is.  Grounding translates:

    Event(tool_call, tool="fraud_check")  -->  {"called(fraud_check)": True}

Both this module and ``formulas/formula.py`` generate predicate key strings
via the shared ``_pred_key.pred_key()`` function, ensuring the keys always
match.  See ``_pred_key.py`` for details.

Predicate catalogue (what this module can currently extract):

    Tool call layer:
        called(X)                 -- tool X was called at this timestep
        count(X)                  -- cumulative invocation count (int, LTL can't count)
        perm(P)                   -- the acting agent holds permission P (static)
        arg_has(tool, pattern)    -- tool args (serialized) match regex ``pattern``
        arg_field_has(tool, field, pattern) -- specific arg field matches regex ``pattern``
        arg_length_exceeds(tool, field, N) -- arg field length > N chars (injection detection)
        arg_paths_within(tool, *prefixes) -- all paths in tool args within allowed prefixes
        contains(field)           -- a data_write event included ``field``
        flow(src, dest)           -- data flowed from agent ``src`` to ``dest``

    P0 — Tool output (requires content in guard_after):
        output_has(tool, pattern) -- tool output matches regex ``pattern``

    P1 — LLM response (requires llm_response event from integration hook):
        llm_said(pattern)         -- LLM output matches regex ``pattern``

    P2 — LLM request (requires llm_request event from integration hook):
        prompt_contains(pattern)  -- LLM input matches regex ``pattern``
        system_prompt_present()   -- LLM request has a system message (structural)
        context_length()          -- total char count of LLM input (int)

    Time layer (event clock — replay-deterministic, not wall-clock):
        now                       -- ts of the current event (float)
        time_since(predicate_key) -- seconds since ``predicate_key`` last
                                     emitted true; sentinel ``1e18`` if
                                     never. Sentinel chosen so any
                                     ``Le(time_since(P), N)`` fails
                                     correctly when P never happened —
                                     "never" is semantically "very long
                                     ago", not "just now". Requested via
                                     ``content_atoms["time_since"]``.

    Args conventions (no event-type schema change):
        data_write.args["scope"]    "internal" | "external" (default
                                     "external"). Internal writes don't
                                     register in ``data_stores`` so a
                                     later cross-agent read won't fire
                                     ``flow()``. ``contains()`` still
                                     emits regardless.
        llm_response.args["segment"] "thinking" | "answer" | other label.
                                     Emits ``segment(value)`` atom at
                                     the timestep so contracts can scope
                                     ``llm_said``-style checks (e.g.
                                     ``Implies(segment("answer"),
                                     ~llm_said(secret))``).

    Parameterized atoms (arg_has, arg_paths_within, output_has, llm_said,
    prompt_contains, time_since) require the caller to pass
    ``content_atoms`` from ``collect_content_atoms()`` so grounding knows
    which patterns to check.

class GroundingState:
    """Persistent accumulators used by incremental grounding.

    Grounding is fundamentally a streaming operation — several predicates
    (``count``, ``flow``, ``count_with``, ``data_stores``) depend on the
    history of events seen so far, not just the current one. This
    dataclass captures all of that state so callers (notably
    :class:`contragent.runtime.verifier.Verifier`) can hold one instance
    across many ``ground_event`` calls and avoid re-scanning the whole
    trace every time.

    The batch :func:`ground` function creates a fresh ``GroundingState``
    internally; incremental callers pass their own long-lived instance.

    Attributes:
        call_counts: Cumulative ``count(tool)`` across the trace seen so far.
        call_with_counts: Cumulative ``count_with(tool, pattern)`` for
            logical-operation matching.
        data_stores: ``key -> {"agent", "contains", "ts"}`` for every
            ``data_write`` observed. Used to derive ``flow()`` on later reads.
        flow_pairs: Set of ``(src, dst)`` agent pairs that ever flowed.
        active_flows: Pre-encoded ``"flow(src, dst)"`` keys that should
            be forward-propagated to every future timestep. Once a flow
            becomes active it stays active for the rest of the session.

    This is the "signal extraction" phase: for each event in the trace,
    determine which atomic predicates (``called``, ``count``,
    ``contains``, ``flow``, ``perm``, ``arg_has``, ``arg_paths_within``,
    etc.) are true.

    This is the **batch** entry point — it always starts from a fresh
    :class:`GroundingState` and grounds every event. For incremental
    grounding across many calls, use :class:`GroundingState` +
    :func:`ground_event` directly (or, more commonly, the
    :class:`contragent.runtime.verifier.Verifier` wrapper which handles the
    bookkeeping for you).

    Args:
        trace: The execution trace to ground.
        agents: Optional mapping of ``agent_id`` to ``Agent`` objects,
            used for permission predicate lookups.
        content_atoms: Optional dict from ``collect_content_atoms()``
            mapping predicate names to sets of arg tuples. When provided,
            grounding performs regex matching against event content and
            populates the corresponding predicate keys.

    Returns:
        A list of dicts, one per timestep, mapping predicate key strings
        (e.g. ``"called(fraud_check)"``) to ``True``.
