"""Formal verifier: does this trace satisfy this formula?

``TraceVerifier`` grounds a trace into per-event predicate valuations
(:func:`contragent.tracer.grounding.ground_event`) and evaluates
ALTLf formulas over them (:func:`contragent.formulas.evaluator.evaluate`,
or a compiled DFA with ``backend="dfa"``). The supervisor owns one
verifier per session; callers that only want to query a formula on a
trace can use it directly::

    v.sync(trace)
    v.check(parse_repr("(!(called('transfer')) U called('verify')) | G(!(called('transfer')))"))

class Verdict:
    """Result of evaluating a single formula on a trace.

    A pure fact — no enforcement decision, no side effect.

    Attributes:
        holds: Whether the formula is satisfied on the current trace.
        desc: Human-readable description of the formula (from
            ``DetFormula.desc`` or ``str(formula)``).
        kind: ``"assumption"`` or ``"guarantee"``. Defaults to
            ``"guarantee"`` for free-standing ``Verifier.check`` calls.
        formula: The original constraint object (``DetFormula`` or
            raw ``Formula``) kept for reporting / ``Violation``
            construction. ``None`` for trivially-true results.
        score: For sto verdicts — the raw confidence in [0, 1] computed
            by ``eval_sto_confidence``. ``None`` for det verdicts.
        threshold: For sto verdicts — the α (assumption) or β (enforcement)
            threshold the score was compared against. ``None`` for det.
        evidence: Optional one-line explanation from the judge / evaluator
            (e.g. ``"judge answered 'no' (conf=0.42)"``).
        suggestion: Optional fix hint surfaced into retry prompts.
        policy_key: Stable lookup key for the user-configured policy map.
            For det verdicts this equals ``desc``. For sto verdicts ``desc``
            is augmented with ``[conf=..., beta=...]`` for human display,
            but ``policy_key`` keeps the bare ``_describe(constraint, ...)``
            string so ``self._policy[stable_key]`` still resolves the
            user's policy overrides (any RetryWithConstraint /
            RedirectToSafe strategy lands on this same key).
            Empty string falls back to ``desc`` for backward compatibility.
        fresh: Whether the latest trace event itself caused this verdict's
            outcome. Only meaningful for ``holds=False`` guarantees:
            ``fresh=True`` means the just-appended event broke the rule and
            should be blocked; ``fresh=False`` means the violation was
            already present on the prefix (stale) and the current event is
            not the cause. The runtime monitor skips stale enforcement
            violations so a single bad event under observe-mode (or any
            other no-rollback path) is not re-blamed on every subsequent
            event. Defaults to ``True`` so callers that don't set it keep
            their pre-existing block-on-violation behavior.

    Args:
        agents: Optional mapping of ``agent_id`` to ``Agent`` objects,
            used by grounding for permission predicates.
        backend: Evaluation strategy. One of:

            - ``"recursive"`` (default) — stateless recursive LTL
              evaluator from :mod:`contragent.formulas.evaluator` with a
              G-node cache. Battle-tested; used by all existing tests.
            - ``"dfa"`` — formula-progression LTL monitor from
              :mod:`contragent.formulas.dfa_evaluator`. Handles nested
              temporal operators (``no_reversal``, ``mutual_exclusion``)
              without the flatness guard the recursive backend needs.
              Stateful per-formula: each formula gets its own
              :class:`~contragent.formulas.dfa_evaluator.DFAEvaluator` that
              is stepped forward as events arrive, giving O(1)
              per-event cost regardless of trace length or formula
              complexity.

            Both backends produce identical :class:`Verdict` objects
            for the same ``(formula, trace)`` input — ``"dfa"`` is a
            drop-in replacement. The recursive backend stays as ground
            truth for differential testing.

    Typical callers:

    * :class:`contragent.runtime.supervisor.Supervisor` wraps one of these
      internally and syncs after every ``check_action`` mutation.
    * Ad-hoc scripts / offline checks: ``v = TraceVerifier(); v.sync(trace); v.check(f)``.

        """True iff the latest event itself caused the enforcement to fail.

        Used to distinguish a brand-new violation introduced by the
        just-appended event from a *stale* violation already present on
        the prefix. Callers only consult this when they already know the
        enforcement does not hold on the full trace.

        For ``G(child)`` we layer three signals:

        1. **Trace transition.** If the formula held on the prefix
           ``valuations[:-1]`` but not now, the latest event flipped it.
           Always fresh.
        2. **Cumulative-aggregate change.** If ``child`` references any
           ``Var`` aggregate (``count(...)``, ``count_with(...)``,
           ``token_count(...)``, ``consecutive_count(...)``,
           ``delegation_depth``, ``time_since(...)``), fresh iff the
           aggregate's value at ``n-1`` differs from ``n-2``. This is
           what keeps ``rate_limit(Bash, 50)`` from re-blaming an
           unrelated submit-prompt event after the count is already
           over budget — count(Bash) didn't move at that event, so it
           wasn't the cause.
        3. **Event-local predicate fail.** If ``child`` has no
           cumulative aggregate, the formula is purely event-local
           (e.g. ``arg_blacklist`` / ``arg_allowlist`` / ``no_pii`` /
           ``arg_value_range``). Fresh iff ``child`` fails at ``n-1`` —
           i.e. *this* event is itself the violator.

        Cases (1) ∨ ((2) when aggregate present) ∨ ((3) when no aggregate)
        — the layering is deliberate: signal (2) only kicks in when an
        aggregate is present, and signal (3) only when none is present.
        This is what lets ``arg_blacklist`` block back-to-back ``rm``
        calls (each is independently a violator) while ``rate_limit``
        ignores unrelated calls after the limit is blown.

        For non-G shapes we use only signal (1) at the contract's
        evaluation position (``0`` for global, ``k_star`` for reactive).

          On the first failure, evaluation stops (short-circuit) and
          the returned ``assumptions`` list ends with that failing
          verdict.
        * **Enforcements** are all evaluated (even if some fail) — but
          only if every assumption held.  Each enforcement is checked
          at position 0 against the *full* trace.

          Suitable for invariants ("if assumption holds throughout,
          then enforcement holds throughout").  See
          ``Contract.activate_at`` docstring.

        **Reactive semantics** (``activate_at == "first_match"``):

        * Each assumption is one of ``F(φ)`` or atomic.  Activation
          point is the first position where φ (resp. the atom) holds.
          The contract activates at the *latest* of all assumptions'
          activation points (since assumptions AND together).
        * If any assumption never activates within the current trace,
          the contract is *vacuously satisfied* — no enforcement
          violations reported.
        * Enforcements are evaluated at position k (the activation
          point), not 0.  Events before k are not subject to E.

          Suitable for trigger-then-enforce safety contracts ("after
          secret read, no outbound POST" should not retroactively flag
          POSTs that happened before the secret read).

        Other notes:

        * Sto constraints (those without a ``formula`` attribute) are
          skipped.
        * Liveness formulas (``DetFormula.liveness == True``) are
          skipped by default — at runtime they can't be enforced by
          blocking, so the monitor ignores them mid-session.  Pass
          ``include_liveness=True`` for offline / end-of-session checks.
